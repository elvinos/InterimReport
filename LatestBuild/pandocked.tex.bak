\section{Aims and Objectives}\label{aims-and-objectives}

The announcement of the new £300million University of Bristol Campus in
Temple Quarter \cite{November58:online}, presents an exciting new
opportunity for development of digital innovations in sustainable
energy. The government's 2020 smart meter rollout, is the first step for
creating a smart energy grid, key to achieving a low-carbon, efficient
energy for the UK \cite{SmartEne79:online}. The UK's vision is inline
with the University of Bristol's new strategy, seeking to boost it's
world-class research capacity and promote policy innovation in
sustainability \cite{universi93:online}. Create a world leading
sustainable digital campus, holds as an attractive means for the
University to achieve it's vision. Consequently, aim of the group
project is to bring a host of new digital technologies reducing both
energy costs and energy usage, uniting these themes, to radically
increase the new campus's sustainability.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{groupDia} shows how the separate themes of the project are
split, where research in Occupancy Sensing, Smart Metering and Building
Services will evaluate how energy usage in the new campus can be
optimised. District Heating, Energy Pricing and Peak Demand Reduction,
all analyse methods of reducing energy costs for the University. Where
new energy pricing structures coupled with peak demand reduction
technologies, can reduce the load on the grid, helping support
sustainable energies. When these separate streams are brought together
in 5\textsuperscript{th}\^{} year, a smart ``brain'' will be created,
combining usage data with reduction in energy costs to provide
sustainable energy services to the campus in that will push the
University to meet it's carbon neutral 2030 goal
\cite{universi93:online}.

\subsection{Individual Project Aim}\label{individual-project-aim}

The aim of this individual project is to investigate the feasibility of
a battery energy storage system to reduce peak energy demand charges for
a new University of Bristol campus. The University's peak demand charges
will be analysed and simulated, showing how peak demand is charged in a
normal use case. Different peak shaving system architectures will then
be added to the model, to find an optimum solution for the system's
design with respect to the system capital cost against peak demand
charge savings. A comparison between using a micro system, for room by
room use, or a macro system, being applied to the whole campus will be
conducted. The outputs of the project for 5\textsuperscript{th} year
will be a flexible model which produces an optimum peak shaving system
architecture for a given University scenario.

\section{Summary of Key Work and
References}\label{summary-of-key-work-and-references}

The following literature review outlines the key technologies required
for developing a optimised peak shaving system and conducting research
intended to justify and develop on the project objectives. Section
\ref{peak-demand-charges-and-loads} looks at pricing structures,
defining the problem which the system has to solve; highlighting the
limitations in current commercially available technology. Section
\ref{peak-shaving-technologies} explores the technologies that can be
used to define the system architecture. Finally, section
\ref{peak-shaving-systems} evaluates current research of energy storage
peak shaving systems, providing a reference for shortlisting different
system architectures.

\subsection{Peak Demand Charges and
Loads}\label{peak-demand-charges-and-loads}

\subsubsection{Pricing Structure}\label{pricing-structure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A charge based on a price per kW, typically the peak kW of the billing
  period\cite{schneiderRECPS}
\item
  Calculated using demand intervals, a short timeframe (often 15
  minutes) during which overall usage is aggregated and tracked as a
  total

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The average calculated is the kW demand for this period
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Peak Shaving is the ability to control your usage from a supplier
  during intervals of high demand, in order to limit or reduce demand
  penalties for the billing period
\item
  After generation costs these are generally the second largest cost per
  kWh on an energy bill
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Current Peak Demand Management
Techniques}\label{current-peak-demand-management-techniques}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To reduce peak demand, you will want to do electrical load planning
  and management. What this means, simply, is scheduling the use of
  electrical equipment to get the work done at the lowest possible
  electric load at any one time \cite{Reducing37:online}
\item
  Key two main methods:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Reducing usage through load shedding- understands which parts of the
    system can be switched off during periods of peak demand - these can
    be intelligent \cite{6199851}
  \item
    Adding capacity with on-site generation \cite{schneiderRECPS}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Typical Loads}\label{typical-loads}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A major factor is how to handle surge loads. Surge loads occur when
  large electric motors are started. These large motors can draw ve
  times normal operating current for a short period of time. It is
  usually necessary to use some type of load starting device such as a
  soft starter or to start the motors sequentially \cite{baldorPS}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Peak Shaving Systems}\label{peak-shaving-systems}

As this project is assessing the feasibility of a electrical energy
storage system that reduce peak demand for the University, a review was
performed to understand research into peak shaving systems. There are a
few commercial products which were assessed first to give guidance on
the architecture of a peak shaving system. A literature review is then
given to understand research around the subject.

\subsubsection{Market Survey}\label{market-survey}

ABB offers energy-storage, smart-grid products, perform load levelling
at grid level \cite{abbpeakshave}. These systems are designed primarily
for supply levelling, using forecasting methods and large electrical
storage systems to offset excess supply produced from renewable energy
sources \cite{5559470}. ABB's products however, do not look at depth
into reducing actual energy costs for the customer, described in section
\ref{peak-demand-charges-and-loads}. One Cycle Control have created
technologies to regulate peak-load and mitigate peak demand charges for
commercial industrial facilities using Li-ion
batteries\cite{peakload38:online}. The technology proved an effective
system at reducing peak demand charges, but it's financial feasibility
is limited by the cost of the storage systems \cite{Demonstr51:online}.
It is clear that the ESS is the most important factor in terms of the
systems cost, whilst being able to sense peak loads and respond actively
will maximise the performance of the system. Section
\ref{peak-shaving-technologies} will evaluate these two different
technologies.

\subsubsection{Peak Shaving Systems Literature
Review}\label{peak-shaving-systems-literature-review}

Understanding the limitations in current market technology, literature
review was performed looking at different research around the battery
type and size required to make appropriate savings, defining micro level
loads on a building or even room and the effect EES's can have at this
level.

\paragraph{Forecasting}\label{forecasting}

By understanding when energy prices will be greater and when loads are
typically larger, a ESS can be switched on during these periods to
reduce demand from the gird. Energy costs can be shifted purchasing at a
cheaper rate and using this during peak times. This method, reduces peak
demand through reducing the total energy demand from the grid. Looking
at the gap in energy prices, demand charges and investment costs for a
BESS system, for NaS, Li-ion and Flow batteries, a basic on/off
algorithm to shift energy purchasing from peak to off peak times does
not produce a viable return on investment (ROI) \cite{7555795}.
\cite{7555793} highlighted that billing peak periods, were directly
correlated meaning that the largest demand was required at the most
expensive periods, requiring large ESS to offset this demand.
\cite{5590194} used real hourly spot prices to decide the best periods
to turn on and off VRB and PSB batteries. Through sequential quadratic
programming (SQP), the battery sizes could be optimised to finding PSB
batteries have a better business case for load shifting. The key
differences between \cite{5590194} and \cite{7555795}, were the
reduction in the size of the problem and the granularity of the pricing
data used. \cite{shen2016} and \cite{6461115} both look at different
modelling techniques to simulate load shifting with EES. Using an
agent-based simulation \cite{6461115}, the diversity in load
consumptions patterns allowed peak demand to be reduced if all energy
use is dynamic. \cite{shen2016} look at how the peak rebate scheme may
lower ROI for ESS's. \cite{6938948} evaluated different control
strategies combing multiple forecasts to reduce errors in peak shaving
over a monthly period. It was found that using weighted and lowest error
forecasts were the best strategies for an energy management system.
\cite{Bennett2015122} added a real time operator to create and
intelligent scheduling system based on a house. This system greatly
improved the state of charge of the battery, allowing more energy
available to reduce peaks. The research highlights that forecasts
combined with real time information can increase the performance of the
system further.

\paragraph{Supply Levelling}\label{supply-levelling}

Supply levelling has been the most common use for ESS
\cite{iearoadmapes}, using large batteries to reduce power fluctuations
brought by the use of renewable technologies. Supply levelling works by
storing excess supply, reducing peaks in supply rather than in demand.
Peak sensing technology is therefore similar to peak shaving.
\cite{Allik20161116}, looked at improving supply on the micro (house)
scale. Shiftable water heating was used as a the main storage device in
houses, accounting for 50\% of household electricity use. Excess load
from wind turbines can be used to heat water in these periods bypassing
an inverter making a more efficient use of the external energy.
Minimising conversion through invertors, makes a large difference in the
efficiency of the system.

\paragraph{Battery Sizing and Financial
Modelling}\label{battery-sizing-and-financial-modelling}

There have been numerous studies conducted looking into the business
case for ESS technologies for industrial/ commercial and household level
consumption. Models such as \cite{7555795} and \cite{7555793} look very
broadly at a reduction in cost across all energy charges. Papers
including \cite{1300158} and \cite{6175723} evaluated a financial models
for particular case studies. Applying bespoke solution helped to
maximise the peak demand reduction greater than what is promised by
current generic products \cite{abbpeakshave}. This enables a strong
argument that a bespoke solution for the University would have improved
performance over a generic system and a much shorter ROI. Further
research has indicated could be benefits for decentralised system,
reducing peaks on a small scale rather than using one large central ESS.
\cite{6604477} looked at both minimising peak demand, whilst maximising
the lifetime on the battery for a large data centre. Although although
based in one location, the ability to forecast when a machine will spike
in power usage, follows a similar to people within a building. Through
both experimentation and modelling, it was revealed that when the
batteries lifespan is taking into account, being able to regulate load
through a series of batteries attached to their own systems can be more
favourable than a decentralised system. This idea is supported by
\cite{Demonstr51:online}, where a simulation was ran of the impact of
lithium-ion batteries operated under a peak-shaving control algorithm to
identify cost-optimal battery configurations and their impact on metered
load. \cite{Demonstr51:online} showed that small short duration
batteries were much more favourable and cost effective for the customer.
The model for this project will assess if this is also the case for a
University facility based on it's usage supported by evidence such as
``40\% of energy use in the campus comes from 5\% of the space,
predominantly labs'' \cite{brentemail} .

Finally \cite{20160601898032}, \cite{Levron201280} all \cite{5371839}
all show alternate ways of optimising the battery sizing
configuration.\cite{5371839}, using an alternate non numeric modelling
method, focusing on ultra capacitors finding the optimal energy storage
of fueled systems. The results emphasise the constraint of storage
capacity, showing limited value gained after a specific size. This
supports evidence that an optimum ESS type and size can be found for a
particular use case. \cite{Levron201280} created an analytical
modelling, leveraging intuitive energy band to regulate the peak load
giving an optimum storage size for a given system. \cite{20160601898032}
looks specifically at Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFB) arguing it's
benefits over other ESS methods. A MATLAB/Simulink was made for a
residential use case, showing that can regulate frequency effectively
due to its fast response time, while still performing peak-shaving
services. A more specified constrained approach to one that is proposed
for this project.

\subsection{Peak Shaving Technologies}\label{peak-shaving-technologies}

\subsubsection{Electrical Energy Storage (EES)
System}\label{electrical-energy-storage-ees-system}

The chosen Electrical Energy Storage (EES) System is the main technology
which will effect the cost and feasibility of a peak shaving system.
where of these technologies are not suitable for a University peak
shaving system. An Electrical Energy Storage (EES) is the process of
converting electrical energy into a form that can be stored for later
use \cite{Chen2009291}. There are various energy storage technologies
available for large-scale applications which can be divided into four
kinds, i.e.~mechanical, electro-magnetic, chemical and electrochemical.

Due to the inherent properties of mechanical and These technologies into
different use cases, categorised as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Energy Management:} for large scale storage, these are
  typically used by power plants for load leveling, ramping/load
  following, and spinning reserve.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    PHS, CAES and CES are the typical technologies for high generation
    above 100MW - these methods are on a scale to large to be considered
    for this system
  \item
    Large-scale batteries, flow batteries, fuel cells, solar fuels, CES
    and TES are suitable for medium-scale energy management with a
    capacity of 10--100 MW, are appropriate for consideration for this
    system
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Power quality:} For fast response times for power quality such
  as the instantaneous voltage drop, flicker mitiga- tion and short
  duration UPS

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Flywheel, batteries, SMES, capacitor and super-capacitor millisecond
    response time lower than 1 MW - suitable perhaps in addition to
    large scale battery, flywheel efficieny to low for operational use.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Bridging power:} Relatively fast response (\textless{} 1 s)
  but also have relatively long discharge time (hours) The typical power
  rating for these types of applications is about 100 kW--10 MW.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Batteries, flow batteries, fuel cells and Metal-Air cells
    \cite{Chen2009291} By removing energy storage methods that would not
    be appropriate for the system, a table was created to compare the
    differing technologies. Due to only batteries and capacitors
    providing the response time and efficiencies required to make the
    system justifiable, only rechargeable batteries were compared. It is
    apparent from the literature review that the model of a University
    peak demand reduction system will need to compare different battery
    parameters along with their cost, in order to optimise the model.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Peak Demand Sensing}\label{peak-demand-sensing}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Two systems, fixed scheduled and anticipated \cite{20164002874437} -
  good citation for university modelling
\item
  Online framework will continuously monitor the real-time demand
  reduction whilst actively perform peak demand reduction

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Required supply from battery for the next interval is defined, in
    which to reduce the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) it is
    computed by bringing the scheduled profile towards the forecasted
    supply, by an approximate factor
  \item
    Four zones in which the battery acts, that is charge, discharge,
    standby and idle. standby is where the battery is boost supplying
  \item
    Boundaries are set for predicted peak
  \item
    forecasted and present demand misalignment is reduced, fluctition
    along the threshold is minimised and energy is conserved only at an
    interval of potential peak demand.
  \item
    These use a method of taking power off the grid at an off peak time
  \item
    Thresholds are adjusted accordingly
  \item
    Both active and passive work , but peak reduction is much more
    consistent for active
  \item
    Where the real-time active control strategy achieved percentage
    reduction of up to 8.64\%, with accuracy of 70.52\% or percentage
    difference of 29.48\% away from the ideal reduction and has
    percentage performance of 77.08\% in achieving the peak demand
    reduction.
  \end{itemize}

\section{Project Risks}\label{project-risks}

This sections highlights the key project risks that this individual
project may encounter. Included with the risks are mitigations
strategies, chosen to reduce the consequences if these risk's occur, see
table \ref{risktab}. Risks are measured using the IPTQ method, explained
below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{P}: Probability of occurrence,
  \textit{1=low, 2=medium, 3 = high}
\item
  \textbf{T}: Time delay caused by risk,
