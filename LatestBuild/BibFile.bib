	Abstract = {Smart grids heavily depend on communication in order to coordinate the generation, distribution, and consumption of energy-even more so if distributed power plants based on renewable energies are taken into account. Given the variety of communication partners, a heterogeneous network infrastructure consisting of IP-based and suitable field-level networks is the most appropriate solution. This paper investigates such a two-tier infrastructure and possible field-level networks with particular attention to metering and supervisory control and data acquisition applications. For the problem of network integration, a combination of gateway and tunneling solutions is proposed which allows a semitransparent end-to-end connection between application servers and field nodes. The feasibility of the approach and implementation details are discussed at the example of powerline communication and IP-based networks investigated in the European research project on real-time energy management via powerlines and internet. Nevertheless, it is shown that the communication architecture is versatile enough to serve as a generic solution for smart grids.},

	Abstract = {A Smart Grid demonstration project is currently underway at Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM). The project combines both residential and commercial loads on a dedicated feeder, with high PV penetration ratio, equipped with a 0.5MW substation-sited photovoltaic (PV) system and large-scale utility storage. The unique aspect of the battery storage system being used, is that both slow (load-shifting) and fast (intermittency-mitigation) power discharge modes are possible. Smart meters and customer Demand Response (DR) management, along with some customer-owned storage will all be implemented. This program targets a minimum of 15% peak-load reduction at a specific feeder through a combination of these the devices and measures. In this paper, we present goals, future plans and current results of modeling for the existing and future infrastructure of this Smart Grid project.},

	Abstract = {This paper is the second of a two-part series, aiming to evaluate the economic feasibility of electrochemical storage systems in peak load shaving applications. The battery energy storage system (BESS) is considered to be added to a private facility, with the aim of reducing the customer electricity bill. The BESS is charged during the night, when the electricity prices are the lowest and discharged during the daily hours, when the prices are the highest, contemporary achieving a leveling of the daily usage pattern. The economical evaluations are carried out considering four different electrochemical technologies: lithium-ion (li-ion), advanced lead-acid, sodium-sulphur (NaS) and flow batteries. First, the total costs and savings are estimated, calculating the net present value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) for each BESS technology. The economic indexes are calculated referring both to 2015 and to the estimated 2020 BESS prices. Second, a parametric analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of several parameters on the economic feasibility of installing a BESS. The considered parameters are: i) the gap between high and low electricity prices; ii) the peak demand charges; iii) the BESS investment costs. The economic analysis reveals that none of the BESS technologies are cost effective at the current BESS prices, without incentives, but the situation could already change in 2020 thanks to the sharp cost decline expected in the coming years.},

	Abstract = {Since the hourly spot market price is available one day ahead, the price could be transferred to the consumers and they may have some motivations to install an energy storage system in order to save their energy costs. This paper presents an optimal operation strategy for a battery energy storage system (BESS) in relation to the real-time electricity price in order to achieve the maximum profits of the BESS. The western Danish power system, which is currently the grid area in the world that has the largest share of wind power in its generation profiles and may represent the future of electricity markets in some ways, is chosen as the studied power system in this paper. Two kinds of BESS, based on polysulfide-bromine (PSB) and vanadium redox (VRB) battery technologies, are studies in the paper. Simulation results show, that the proposed optimal operation strategy is an effective measure to achieve maximum profits of the BESS. The results also show that it will take longer time to return the original investment of the VRB battery. So the PSB battery is the better investment choice for the time being.},

	Abstract = {Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) are gaining more and more attention in the current global energy landscape, thanks to some peculiar characteristics such as the versatility, modularity, scalability, fast response time, etc. BESSs can advantageously be used in the ancillary services market, in order to provide all the services necessary to ensure the stability and the reliability of the power system. Among other applications, BESS can also be used to shift electricity demand from on-peak to off-peak periods, also contributing to relieve peak demand charges, thus ensuring a saving for the customers. The BESS is charged when the electricity prices are the lowest (during the night) and discharged when the prices are the highest (during the daily hours), contemporary achieving a leveling of the daily usage pattern. This paper is the first of a two-part series, aiming to evaluate the economic feasibility of electrochemical storage systems in peak load shaving applications. The sizing and the operating strategy of the BESS are defined, so as to obtain, at the same time, the flattest daily usage pattern and the maximum benefit for the customer. A case study is analyzed, showing the modification of the power diagram when the BESS is added. The simulation results show a customer daily power profile perfectly leveled in shoulder seasons and a peak shaving effect in all other days.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Three phase battery energy storage (BES) installed in the residential low voltage (LV) distribution network can provide functions such as peak shaving and valley filling (i.e. charge when demand is low and discharge when demand is high), load balancing (i.e. charge more from phases with lower loads and discharge more to phases with higher loads) and management of distributed renewable energy generation (i.e. charge when rooftop solar photovoltaics are generating). To accrue and enable these functions an intelligent scheduling system was developed. The scheduling system can reliably schedule the charge and discharge cycles and operate the \{BES\} in real time. The scheduling system is composed of three integrated modules: (1) a load forecast system to generate next-day load profile forecasts; (2) a scheduler to derive an initial charge and discharge schedule based on load profile forecasts; and (3) an online control algorithm to mitigate forecast error through continuous schedule adjustments. The scheduling system was applied to an \{LV\} distribution network servicing 128 residential customers located in an urban region of South East Queensland, Australia. },

	Abstract = {The development of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is considered to be very important for peak shaving and power demand normalization, especially in an autonomous power system. This paper presents a control scheme based on a cascade of an external controller that regulates the active and reactive power to generate reference currents and an internal current controller which produces gating signals for the inverter semiconductor switches. The proposed control algorithm takes the state of charge (SOC%) of the battery system into account and implements an active power command override to satisfy the requirements of the SOC% limits of the batteries. System simulations are performed during discharging and charging modes of operation as well as during the active power command override mode for several power demand step variations. The evaluation of the results shows good system performance and dynamic behavior.},

	Abstract = {Prompted by technical issues that have arisen due to the widespread deployment of distributed intermittent renewable generators, rapidly rising peak demand and reductions in battery price, the use of battery-based energy storage systems in power networks is on the rise. While battery-based energy storage has the potential to deliver technical benefits, the best possible sizing, location and usage govern the financial viability. The objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, a generalised approach is proposed to model network upgrade deferral as a function of load growth rate, renewable generation penetration and peak shave fraction. This model is then used for the formulation of an optimisation problem which benefits from multi-period power flow analysis to co-optimise battery size, location, charge/discharge profile for a pre-specified number of units to be deployed in a given distribution network. The proposed approach is implemented using the generic algebraic modelling system platform and validated on an Australian medium voltage distribution network under multiple practical and potential future scenarios.},

	Abstract = {An adaptive control method is proposed for applying ``peak shaving'' to the grid electrical demand of a single building, using a battery energy storage system to reduce the maximum demand. The objective is to save cost by reducing the monthly ``demand charges'' commonly levied on commercial power customers. Multiple demand forecasts are evaluated at every time step during each day, and combined to calculate a maximum limit to which the grid demand is controlled. Whereas prior methods apply peak shaving to every day alike, our method does not attempt to reduce peak demand below the maximum reached in the same month. The results show greater monthly demand cost reduction than a previously published method.},

	Abstract = {Grid connected energy storage systems are regarded as promising solutions for providing ancillary services to electricity networks and to play an important role in the development of smart grids. Thus far, the more mature battery technologies have been installed in pilot projects and studies have indicated their main advantages and shortcomings. The main concerns for wide adoption are the overall cost, the limited number of charging cycles (or lifetime), the depth of discharge, the low energy density and the sustainability of materials used. Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFB) are a promising option to mitigate many of these shortcomings, and demonstration projects using this technology are being implemented both in Europe and in the USA. This study presents a model using MATLAB/Simulink, to demonstrate how a VRFB based storage device can provide multi-ancillary services, focusing on frequency regulation and peak-shaving functions. The study presents a storage system at a medium voltage substation and considers a small grid load profile, originating from a residential neighbourhood and fast charging stations demand. The model also includes an inverter controller that provides a net power output from the battery system, in order to offer both services simultaneously. Simulation results show that the VRFB storage device can regulate frequency effectively due to its fast response time, while still performing peak-shaving services. VRFB potential in grid connected systems is discussed to increase awareness of decision makers, while identifying the main challenges for wider implementation of storage systems, particularly related to market structure and standardisation requirements. &copy; 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Managing the stored energy usually presents a complicated optimization problem. In this paper, we show an optimal ``peak shaving'' strategy, that enables minimization of the power peak and derive an analytic design method for attaining optimal peak shaving. The analysis reveals the lowest possible peak, given only the load's demand profile and the storage capacity. The effects of losses in the storage device are analyzed numerically, showing the increase of power peak associated with the increase of loss. },

	Abstract = { AbstractA microgrid that consists of distributed energy sources, such as micro turbines, wind turbines, fuel cells, and photovoltaic panels, storage devices and a group of radial load feeders are quickly rising in popularity in recent years. Because there are various controllable units in a microgrid, it has the potential to provide ancillary services (A/Ss) for the grid in the grid-connected mode. This article proposes a novel microgrid energy management strategy with demand response to provide peak shaving for the grid by using the peak-time rebate scheme. Under this scheme, various controllable units, such as controllable loads, battery storage, and diesel generators, participate voluntarily in the demand-response program to achieve maximum profit for the microgrid, so the microgrid can respond actively to the grid. The optimal energy management for the microgrid is achieved under this scheme. In addition, the main grid can benefit from the scheme with a lower cost compared with other traditional peak-shaving programs. Various incentive rewards of the peak-time rebate and demand-response levels of the controllable loads are discussed in the peak-time rebate scheme. The results demonstrate that the peak power of the grid tie-line is shaved markedly while achieving optimal energy management. },

Our novel distributed battery control design has no performance impact, reduces the peak power needs, and accurately estimates and maximizes the battery lifetime. We demonstrate that models which do not take into account physical characteristics of batteries overestimate their lifetime by 2.4x. In contrast, our design is within 3.3% of the centralized battery control in terms of battery lifetime with 10x reduction in the communication costs, while shaving 23MWhrs/week of energy in a 10MW datacenter, equivalent to adding 8760 more servers at no additional power cost.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This paper addresses the problems of output power distribution and variability of small wind turbines. The aim of the study was to increase the share of locally consumed renewable energy and decrease power fluctuation in residential houses that meet their energy demand using wind energy. A system with shiftable water heating and decreased inverter power, which avoids unnecessary conversion steps for shifting of power peaks is proposed. Autocorrelation functions were used to analyse the energy consumption and production patterns for optimization of the inverter and hot water storage tank size for load shifting. The optimal sizing of these components for applying the method was found for different wind conditions. The results of simulations with high temporal resolution data and experiments showed that the proposed system is able to shave stochastic power peaks and shift electrical loads. The analysis of net energy flow revealed that the renewable energy cover factors can be enhanced by 14.4--36.0% and the wind turbine's nominal inverter power can be decreased down to 29.2--52.3% without increasing the system's energy losses or changing the hot water consumption pattern. },

	Abstract = {The merits of electricity grid in Shanghai and sodium sulfur (NaS) storage techniques situation are introduced. High-energy NaS battery energy storage system (BESS) is very suitable for peak shaving of electricity grid. A cost--benefit analysis model of NaS BESS is established to study the electricity price mechanism in load shift in the light of an example of NaS BESS in Meisei University. Capacity price, energy price and twofold electricity price mechanism are discussed under the fixed payback period. The results show that twofold electric power price mechanism is fitter for NaS BESS than onefold energy price mechanism while onefold capacity price mechanism is not suitable for NaS BESS. The discharge price of NaS BESS has an advantage over Shanghai's electricity price in industrial and commercial peak periods when its construction cost descends to 1000 yuan kWh−1.

Realistic 5 min time-step electricity profiles were input to an energy storage model with the objective of reducing the peak electricity demand seen by the electricity grid. The model simulates and provides performance results of a range of battery and inverter sizes specific to a variety of residential houses. The results suggest typical system sizes range from 5 kWh/2.6 kW for low electricity intensity homes to 22 kWh/5.2 kW for electricity intense homes with electric space heating. Based on the resulting storage system cycling profile and data provided by other researchers, the battery life is estimated to be in the range of 10{\^a}€``20 years for this application. },

	Abstract = {Battery-based energy storage (BESS) has found to have potential and interest in reducing the peak demand. Over the years, a number of control strategies have been developed for BESS to reduce the peak demand. The control strategies are however complex and confined to simulation evaluation only. The control strategies are also not tested in BESS set-up with limited capacity. A simple and yet comprehensive real-time active peak demand reduction control has therefore been developed and presented in this paper. The real-time active control has been evaluated experimentally using the university building as the site. The performance of the real-time control has been evaluated as compared to the fundamental control as well as the ideal reduction in simulation. Even though the capacity is limited, the results showed superiority and adoptability of the real-time active control as compared to the fundamental control, with peak demand reduction of about 8.64% as compared to 4.24%. The real-time active control also showed higher accuracy of 70.52% towards the ideal reduction result as compared to the fundamental control with only 35.25%. &copy; 2016 Journal of Communications.},

	Abstract = {Flattening household electricity demand reduces generation costs, since costs are disproportionately affected by peak demands. While the vast majority of household electrical loads are interactive and have little scheduling flexibility (TVs, microwaves, etc.), a substantial fraction of home energy use derives from background loads with some, albeit limited, flexibility. Examples of such devices include A/Cs, refrigerators, and dehumidifiers. In this paper, we study the extent to which a home is able to transparently flatten its electricity demand by scheduling only background loads with such flexibility. We propose a Least Slack First (LSF) scheduling algorithm for household loads, inspired by the well-known Earliest Deadline First algorithm. We then integrate the algorithm into Smart-Cap, a system we have built for monitoring and controlling electric loads in homes. To evaluate LSF, we collected power data at outlets, panels, and switches from a real home for 82 days. We use this data to drive simulations, as well as experiment with a real testbed implementation that uses similar background loads as our home. Our results indicate that LSF is most useful during peak usage periods that exhibit ``peaky'' behavior, where power deviates frequently and significantly from the average. For example, LSF decreases the average deviation from the mean power by over 20% across all 4-hour periods where the deviation is at least 400 watts.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The presented work focuses on energy management strategy, to operate a grid connected active \{PV\} system (APS) in a microgrid. A microgrid is a smart grid in a small scale which can be stand-alone or grid-tied. The proposed system is based on photovoltaic system, batteries and ultra-capacitors. Three converters are used to interface the elements of the \{APS\} to a common DC-link capacitor. The presented control strategy manages the power flow between the converters and the grid through the DC-link in order to maintain the grid power demand coming from the grid operator. Batteries are used as an energy source, to stabilize and permit the \{APS\} units to run at a constant and stable output power, damping peak surges in electricity demand and to store the excess of energy from the \{PV\} array. Ultra-capacitors are used as a fast power regulator to: limit the battery{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s current, regulate the DC-link voltage when the disconnection mode occurs and to deliver a smooth power to the grid, despite primary source and load fluctuations. Several operating modes are presented to manage locally the power flows between the various sources, taking into account the state of charge of batteries (SOC), the energy level of ultra-capacitors (Lev), the available \{PV\} power and the power demand from the grid operator. },

	Abstract = {This paper aims to present a detailed analysis on the impact that demand side bidding (DSB) has on microgrids operation, taking into account variations in market prices, RES production, and seasonal demand for a typical LV network. Additionally, the economic impact of applying adequacy constraints, i.e. request specific part of the microgrid demand to be supplied by local power production, in case of intentional islanding, is estimated. This is essential to achieve seamless transition from interconnected to autonomous operation of microgrids. Two cases are examined: adequacy constraint applied to the whole microgrid demand and only to the critical loads. Moreover, the magnitude and frequency of interruption of critical and noncritical loads, in case of an upstream network fault is calculated. The potential of DSB to reduce operating costs improving at the same time the quality of service to the loads of higher priority is shown. Copyright {\copyright} 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
