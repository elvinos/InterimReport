## Individual Project Aim

The aim of this individual project is to investigate the feasibility of a battery energy storage system to reduce peak energy demand charges for a new University of Bristol campus. The University’s peak demand charges will be analysed and simulated, showing how peak demand is charged in a normal use case. Different peak shaving system architectures will then be added to the model, to find an optimum solution for the system's design with respect to the system capital cost against peak demand charge savings. A comparison between using a micro system, for room by room use, or a macro system, being applied to the whole campus will be conducted. The outputs of the project for 5^th^ year will be a flexible model which produces an optimum peak shaving system architecture for a given University scenario.

## Objectives

**Literature Review**
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform a detailed literature review to investigate applicable peak shaving technologies based on similar use cases and performance. Research will include:
    \begin{itemize}
 \item a down-selection of different energy storage solutions, looking at their applicability to a University peak shaving system, comparing parameters such as; power-ratings , discharge times, charge times and costs.
\item investigating different prediction methods for peak demand surges, identifying limitations in current technology.
    \end{itemize}
\item Conduct research of different peak shaving systems, highlighting relevant modelling techniques and limitations.
\end{enumerate}

**Definition of System Architectures**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Define peak shaving system architectures, establishing the key performance variables.
\end{enumerate}

**Modelling and Analysis**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Analyse the University’s current peak demand charges. This will include understanding the University’s current demand charge structure and collecting typical energy usage data. Parameters such as time of day and sources of energy peaks will be included.
\item Produce a simulation to optimise the peak shaving system, comparing metrics including; unit cost and reduction in peak kWh charges based on University billing structure. This model will provide a comparative analysis between the different system architectures. This will detail savings against the University’s current peak demand charges. The model will be comprised of three stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A simulation of the University's a normal energy use case and peak demand charges, for use as a datum.
\item Inclusion of energy storage systems, simulating logic and detailing any prediction methods.
\item Addition of other factors to improve the model, taken from the literature review. This will take into other technologies such as peak load shedding to understand if peak demand can be further reduced.
\end{enumerate}
\item Analyse others areas where the system could deliver further benefits, such as AC to DC conversion, PV’s, micro-grids and increased sustainability.
\end{enumerate}

**Evaluation**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Evaluate results of the simulation, concluding on the effectiveness of different peak shaving system architectures against particular scenarios.
\end{enumerate}
