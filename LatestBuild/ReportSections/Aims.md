# Aims and Objectives

The announcement of the new £300million University of Bristol Campus in Temple Quarter \cite{November58:online}, presents an exciting new opportunity for development of digital innovations in sustainable energy. The government's 2020 smart meter rollout, is the first step for creating a smart energy grid, key to achieving a low-carbon, efficient energy for the UK \cite{SmartEne79:online}. The UK's vision is inline with the University of Bristol's new strategy, seeking to boost it's world-class research capacity and promote policy innovation in sustainability \cite{universi93:online}. Create a world leading sustainable digital campus, holds as an attractive means for the University to achieve it's vision. Consequently, aim of the group project is to bring a host of new digital technologies reducing both energy costs and energy usage, uniting these themes, to radically increase the new campus's sustainability.

Figure \ref{groupDia} shows how the separate themes of the project are split, where research in Occupancy Sensing, Smart Metering and Building Services will evaluate how energy usage in the new campus can be optimised. District Heating, Energy Pricing and Peak Demand Reduction, all analyse methods of reducing energy costs for the University. Where new energy pricing structures coupled with peak demand reduction technologies, can reduce the load on the grid, helping support sustainable energies. When these separate streams are brought together in 5^th^^ year, a smart "brain" will be created, combining usage data with reduction in energy costs to provide sustainable energy services to the campus in that will push the University to meet it's carbon neutral 2030 goal \cite{universi93:online}.

## Individual Project Aim

The aim of this individual project is to investigate the feasibility of a battery energy storage system to reduce peak energy demand charges for a new University of Bristol campus. The University’s peak demand charges will be analysed and simulated, showing how peak demand is charged in a normal use case. Different peak shaving system architectures will then be added to the model, to find an optimum solution for the system's design with respect to the system capital cost against peak demand charge savings. A comparison between using a micro system, for room by room use, or a macro system, being applied to the whole campus will be conducted. The outputs of the project for 5^th^ year will be a flexible model which produces an optimum peak shaving system architecture for a given University scenario.

## Objectives

**Literature Review**
\begin{enumerate}
\item Research different peak shaving systems available on the market and similar systems designs in literature, highlighting relevant modelling techniques and limitations.
\item Perform a detailed literature review to investigate applicable peak shaving technologies based on similar use cases and performance. Research will include:
    \begin{itemize}
 \item a down-selection of different energy storage solutions, looking at their applicability to a University peak shaving system, comparing parameters such as; power-ratings , discharge times, charge times and costs.
\item investigating different prediction methods for peak demand surges, identifying limitations in current technology.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

**Definition of System Architectures**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Define peak shaving system architectures, establishing the key performance variables.
\end{enumerate}

**Modelling and Analysis**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Analyse the University’s current peak demand charges. This will include understanding the University’s current demand charge structure and collecting typical energy usage data. Parameters such as time of day and sources of energy peaks will be included.
\item Produce a simulation to optimise the peak shaving system, comparing metrics including; unit cost and reduction in peak kWh charges based on University billing structure. This model will provide a comparative analysis between the different system architectures. This will detail savings against the University’s current peak demand charges. The model will be comprised of three stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A simulation of the University's a normal energy use case and peak demand charges, for use as a datum.
\item Inclusion of energy storage systems, simulating logic and detailing any prediction methods.
\item Addition of other factors to improve the model, taken from the literature review. This will take into other technologies such as peak load shedding to understand if peak demand can be further reduced.
\end{enumerate}
\item Analyse others areas where the system could deliver further benefits, such as AC to DC conversion, PV’s, micro-grids and increased sustainability.
\end{enumerate}

**Evaluation**
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Evaluate results of the simulation, concluding on the effectiveness of different peak shaving system architectures against particular scenarios.
\end{enumerate}
